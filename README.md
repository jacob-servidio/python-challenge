The file called main.py is the main script ran for each analysis.
The "Resources" folder contains the CSV files used. 
The "analysis" folder contains the file that has the results from the code ran.

-PyBank-

This script is used to analyze the financial records from Jan-2010 to Feb-2017 for the company.

When run the code calculates:

-The total number of months included in the dataset

-The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
